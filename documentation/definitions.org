*Note

 This section will impose consistency and uniformity across the
 documentation.  I am very actively soliciting suggestions for
 improvement on the namings and the definitions.

* Congruent arrays
  Two arrays are congruent if the have the same rank and have all
  dimensions same.

* Hyperspec references
  We references chapters and sections in the hyperspec as
  CLHS-X.Y.Z
