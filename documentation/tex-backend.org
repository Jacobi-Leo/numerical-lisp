#+title: TeX back-end

* Aim
  NL will provide facilities for generating output in various TeX
  formats.  Initially LaTeX, but if desired for ConTeXt and others.
  For example, numbers with units can be generated in syntax of the
  siunits package.  Tables can be formated for LaTeX or pgf-tables
  And plots could formated for pgf plots.

  

* Programming structure
  This back-end should be independent of NL.  If NL's data structures
  are generic enough, the back-end will process them.
