#+title: General notes about Numeric Lisp (NL)

* Relation between NL, CL, and Antik

  Much of NL derives from Antik.  In fact, a primary goal is to derive
  NL from the Antik code base, and then for Antik to be re-built
  around NL.  The hope is that this will allow other functionality to
  relativly easily build both on top and along Antik's.

* Packages

  NL introduces the NL package.  This package redefines math, array
  creation, and array access functions.  It also permanently shadows
  the symbols CL:FIRST, CL:SECOND, ... CL:TENTH.  Some of those are
  replaced by new symbols, (SECOND, THIRD, FIFTH, TENTH)

  These namespaces can be used directly, in which case the shadowed
  CL symbols can be accessed using the CL package designator.
