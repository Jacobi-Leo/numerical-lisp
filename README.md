numerical-lisp
==============

A specification for a common-lisp-based language for numerical computations

I started this project based on recent discussions on Common Lisp Statistics (see https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/lisp-stat/MkyN1fiG9nA)

My goal is to enable the creation of a programming, numerical analysis and visualization environment based on common lisp.

This environment will redefine (shadow) some of CL's symbols - thus the name Numerical Lisp.  However, the shaddowed symbols will always be accessible.

This project will initially consists of my notes on how to proceed, and will incorporate inputs and comments of others.

Eventually we will move on to coding.

It is quite possible that this github project will terminate, and/or be handed over to someone that can put it more effort and energy into it.
