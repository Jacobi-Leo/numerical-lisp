#+title: NL library and package

* Aim

  Top-level definitions of NL.  Also the place to discuss the
  shadowing of existing CL symbols



* DEF-NL-PACKAGE macro

  The NL package provides a CL-like package definition command via
  ~def-nl-package~, whose syntax is identical to ~cl:defpackage~.
  ~def-nl-package~ automatically shadows certain CL symbols and also
  exports them.  The NL package also exports additional new symbols
  related to macros for flow control, numerical analysis,
  visualization.

* Re-definition of existing CL symbols

  Many math-related CL symbols are redefined to be able to handle
  different types of arrays, and elements (such as numbers with
  units attached to them).
