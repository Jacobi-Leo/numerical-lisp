#+title: Functions and macros for mapping and reducing vectors and arrays

* Goals
  Extend CL's iterating functions to all arrays that NL supports

  
* Mapping functions and macros for grids
  
  Link to [[http://github.com/mirkov/map-grid-utils-1.git][map-grid-utils]] (a utility definitely not
  written with parallelizm in mind)

* Walker macros

  Sometimes we want to map over one or more grids to produce another
  grid.  At other times we want to walk over a grid to execute an
  action.  The first type is a functional type while he other not.

  For example, a walker over a grid might be generating commands to
  send grid elements to a file.
