#+title: Numerical functions

*** Re-definitions of existing common lisp functions and macros

    All math functions listed in CLHS-12 accept numeric arrays as
    arguments.  The arrays have to be congruent.  Then the functions
    are performing a mapping of the function over consecutive array
    elements.

    The functions can also accept a mixture of arrays and scalars.  In
    that case during the mapping, the scalar arguments always provide
    the same value.

** Numerical analysis routines
   NL provides a CL interface to many numerical analysis operations.
   These operations are actually done by external libraries, such as
   GSLL, LAPACK or others.

   The goal is to create a unified interface, but at the same time
   give the user the possibility to set a default library, or
   directly call a specific library routine.

   This part is probably very complex, as we are striving for both
   unity and flexibility.
