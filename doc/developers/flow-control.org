#+title: Flow control macros

* Flow control for  parallel computing

  NL will strive to introduce control structures suited for parallel
  computing.  In parallel computations, iterations such as DO and
  LOOP are inherently serial (references, and verify).  Instead, one
  needs to perform operations that are much more like MAP and REDUCE.

  We want to provide a general interface, and several
  back-ends for different architectures (GPU, MIC, Parallel cores).
